# SCP Classification Model

#### A work in progress machine learning project by Daniel Fischer

### What is the goal of this project?

The current goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that is able to correctly classify text articles from  [the SCP wiki](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com) and use the frequency of each unique word to determine the nature of the article. The SCP Wiki is a collaborative internet writing project in which users submit articles outlining anomalous creatures, objects and/or locations, posing as a member of the fictional "SCP Foundation" who seek out and try to contain these anomalies. Each article on the site is assigned an 'object class' attribute which represents how difficult the anomaly is to contain.
